# ExtLaunch
An extremely minimal Android launcher for externally connected displays.

# Caveats
- Cursor support does not work (Android limitation, pointer is restricted to primary display unless ForceDesktopMode is enabled in Developer Options. You can use that as a workaround).
- App's must be in focus to send input. Tl;Dr: You cannot be playing Minecraft with a control while also scrolling Reddit. You must focus on or the other.
- Google Chromecast is not supported. It only allows mirroring.

# Which Displays Are Supported
- HDMI (USB-C / MHI as well)
- Miracast
- AirServer
- Windows Connect
- WFD
- Probably others

# How To Use
1. Connect a display
2. Open ExtLaunch
3. Tap an app to start

# How To Switch Displays
Use the ongoing notification to switch the active application between displays. This also refocuses the application.

# Play Store
This application is paid ($0.99 USD) on the Play Store. It'd mean a lot if you paid for it, however, I wanted to make this application Open Source as well for ongoing support, similar applications, etc. Feel free to consider it a donation, or build it manually if you'd like.
